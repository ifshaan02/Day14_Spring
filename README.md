SPRING MVC CRUD

This is a simple Spring MVC CRUD application that demonstrates how to manage employees using Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. It uses Spring MVC for handling web requests, Spring Data JPA with Hibernate for database interactions, and MySQL as the backend database. The application allows you to add new employees, view a list of all employees, edit employee details, and delete records. Views are built with JSP pages for displaying forms and tables. This project serves as a basic template for learning or building enterprise-level applications with Spring MVC and can easily be extended with features like validation, pagination, or REST APIs.
